DESCRIPTION
===========

pscorer is a C++ implementation of the phrase scoring in phrase-based systems.
This is a hybrid parallel version. It uses multiple cores on multiple machines.
It was developed and tested in a Linux environment, with GNU g++.

DEPENDENCIES
============

This software depends on the following libraries:

    - STXXL: 
        Download and installation instructions can be found at: http://stxxl.sourceforge.net/
        Please build it in the parallel mode (e.g. make library_g++_pmode)

    - DEMsort: Distributed sort which uses STXXL. Available at: http://algo2.iti.kit.edu/documents/DEM-sort-lib.tar.gz

    - nlopt: non linear optimization: http://ab-initio.mit.edu/wiki/index.php/NLopt

We use AnyOption command line parser (https://github.com/hackorama/AnyOption). The code was downloaded and included without major modifications (you don't have to do anything for this to work. I just added this comment to acknowledge it usage)

COMPILING
=========

- Edit the file make.settings.local, which will tell the compiler where the STXXL is located. It also indicates the mpiCC command.

The maximum value of key strings is 250 (this worked very well for our fr-en systems), 
it can be set to any other value. However, the larger the slower and the more disk space needed.
This can be manually changed in the file scorer_types.h (Many other constants can be modified here, such as the number of Kneser-Ney constants to be considered (3 by default)).

Proceed by issuing make command (assuming that this corresponds to GNU make).





I will edit this file later!
